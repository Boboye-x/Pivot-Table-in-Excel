# Pivot-Table-in-Excel
I obtained Bike Sales Data from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/sadiqshah/bike-store-sales-in-europe/data
I thus proceeded to create two pivot tables showing sum of revenue, cost, and profit per country and state under each country.
The second table shows sum of revenue per year for each country.
